# Balatro AP Mod

This is a Mod for [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) that provides Integration for [Archipelago Multi World](https://archipelago.gg) as well as the mod [Qualatro](https://github.com/SiIvaGunner/qualatro/).

This mod is heavily based off of the work of [BalatroAP](https://github.com/BurndiL/BalatroAP), and all rightful credit goes to both BurndiL (for the original mod) and to the people at SiIvaGunner (for creating Qualatro).
This mod will not work with the original BalatroAP mod, but instructions for installation are otherwise identical.
